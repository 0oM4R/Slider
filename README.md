# Slider
#### Simple slider using Html,CSS JavaScript and Bootstrap.
In this project I'm practicing DOM so may you found some unwanted mistakes in the style.
Any way, this project shows six pictures with description and if you click on the picture the slide will open and display the targeted picture.
Also You can move to the next picture by pressing the right arrow on keyboard or click on the right arrow button, the same to move to the previous picture,you click or press on the left arrow.
Finally you can close the slide by clicking on the close button or pressing escape button on keyboard.
