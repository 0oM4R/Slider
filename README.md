# Slider
#### Simple slider using Html,CSS JavaSqript and Bootstrap.
on this project I'm practicing on DOM so may you found some unwanted mistakes on the style.
Any way ,this project shows six pictures with description and if you click on the picture the slide will open and displaying the targeted pictur.
Also You can move to the next picture by press right arrow on keyboard or click on the right arrow button, as the same to move to the previous picture,you click or press on the left arrow.
Finally you can close the slide by click on close button or press escape button on keyboard .
